Our API is organized around REST. Our API has predictable, resource-oriented URLs, and uses ``HTTP response codes`` to indicate API errors. All responses are returned in JSON, including errors.
   
Our API only accepts ``application/json`` content type, so you must always specify ``Accept: application/json`` header in every request you make.

The main API endpoint is ``https://app.solutionsitw.com/cxm/api/``
